Number guessing algorithm by Viridescence

This algorithm will guess a number between the maximum and minimum parameter values by asking yes/no questions. 
It does this in the most efficient way by asking if the number is higher/lower than the midpoint between the two numbers.
Uses this information to create a new lower/upper bound.
Only works with whole numbers, however
